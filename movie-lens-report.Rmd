## Introduction

(an **introduction/overview/executive summary** section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed)

Recommendation systems allow users to get recommendations by leveraging ratings made by the same and other users. One common application is the recommendation of movies. Users input their ratings of movies, typically using a 5-star scale, and based on this input, and other users ratings, the system predicts how the current user would rate the set of movies.

The GroupLens Research Group at the University of Minnesota publishes multiple versions of 'MovieLens', a dataset of movie ratings, so that other interested parties can analyze and learn from it. In this work, we utilize a [version of their dataset](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html) that includes 10 million ratings selected randomly from their complete dataset.

These types of systems happen to be a great learning tool as we can apply a variety of machine learning techniques to try and come up with good recommendations. We model the problem as a function that accounts for multiple effects given by different features of the dataset. The objective is to minimize the root mean square error when comparing the predicted ratings to the actual ratings. The model looks like so:

$$
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n + \varepsilon_{u,i}
$$

where:

$\mu$ is the average rating of all movies in the dataset

$b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n$ models different "bias" that we want to account for

$\varepsilon_{u,i}$ is the error for each movie and user pair when comparing to the actual ratings

$Y_{u,i}$ is the predicted ratings for all movie and user pairs.
